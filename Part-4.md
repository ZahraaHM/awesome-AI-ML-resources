This should encompass the model's ability to predict each of the training classes and give us insight into any biases that may exist on the model. By having these clear metrics, we can get a good idea of how the model will perform when deployed into production, which will ultimately drive performance of the product and its impact in the market.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |https://www.notion.so/Model-Evaluation-97bfa579b9684733b1b3b52c449daedc                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |Article                                                |All Levels  |Toma                                     |March 13, 2021   |

Huge hype cycles and rapidly evolving tools, though, have blurred the lines between the two, making it difficult to tell where AI ends and AR begins. This post aims to disambiguate AR and AI. It covers how AR and AI work together, the current state of SDKs and APIs for each, and some practical ways to combine them to build incredible mobile experiences.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/combining-artificial-intelligence-and-augmented-reality-in-mobile-apps-e0e0ad2cfddc                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |Article                                                |All Levels  |Toma                                     |March 13, 2021   |

Second, it trains a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify residential buildings into architectural styles, taking into account spatial dependencies of these styles. Third, it investigates whether architectural styles influence house prices. For resales , the architectural style is a significant determinant of transaction prices while no such effect is found for new buildings.
