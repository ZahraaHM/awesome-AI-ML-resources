In light of recent advances in machine intelligence, a num-ber of scientists, philosophers and technologists have revived the discussion about the potentiallycatastrophic risks entailed by such an entity.  In this article, we trace the origins and developmentof the neo-fear of superintelligence, and some of the major proposals for its containment. We arguethat total containment is, in principle, impossible, due to fundamental limits inherent to comput-ing itself. Assuming that a superintelligence will contain a program that includes all the programsthat can be executed by a universal Turing machine on input potentially as complex as the state ofthe world, strict containment requires simulations of such a program, something theoretically (andpractically) impossible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |https://jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/12202/26642                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |Article                                                |All Levels  |Alexa.N.                                 |January 18, 2021 |

Most studies of machine behavior modelling, however, rely on symbolic or selected parametric sensory inputs and built-in knowledge relevant to a given task. Here, we propose that an observer can model the behavior of an actor through visual processing alone, without any prior symbolic information and assumptions about relevant inputs. To test this hypothesis, we designed a non-verbal non-symbolic robotic experiment in which an observer must visualize future plans of an actor robot, based only on an image depicting the initial scene of the actor robot. We found that an AI-observer is able to visualize the future plans of the actor with 98.5% success across four different activities, even when the activity is not known a-priori. We hypothesize that such visual behavior modeling is an essential cognitive ability that will allow machines to understand and coordinate with surrounding agents, while sidestepping the notorious symbol grounding problem. Through a false-belief test, we suggest that this approach may be a precursor to Theory of Mind, one of the distinguishing hallmarks of primate social cognition.|https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-77918-x?utm_source=red&utm_medium=nl&utm_campaign=ada&utm_content=2021117                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |Article                                                |All Levels  |Alexa.N.                                 |January 18, 2021 |

To predict which mutations may lead to viral escape, Hie et al. used a machine learning technique for natural language processing with two components: grammar (or syntax) and meaning (or semantics) (see the Perspective by Kim and Przytycka). Three different unsupervised language models were constructed for influenza A hemagglutinin, HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike glycoprotein. Semantic landscapes for these viruses predicted viral escape mutations that produce sequences that are syntactically and/or grammatically correct but effectively different in semantics and thus able to evade the immune system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6526/284?utm_source=red&utm_medium=nl&utm_campaign=ada&utm_content=2021117                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |Article                                                |Intermediate|Alexa.N.                                 |January 18, 2021 |

They have also come to realize how unready the state of modeling was for this pandemic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-hard-lessons-of-modeling-the-coronavirus-pandemic-20210128/                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |Article                                                |All Levels  |Joanna Pol                               |February 3, 2021 |

Probability Calibration of classifiers deals with the process of optimizing the output of classifiers so that the outputs of the classifier model can be directly interpreted as a confidence level and Pava inspects the points and if it finds a point that violates the constraints, it pools that value with its adjacent members which ultimately go on to form a block.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/02/isotonic-regression-and-the-pava-algorithm/                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |Article                                                |Intermediate|Etendra Verma                            |February 10, 2021|

This should encompass the model's ability to predict each of the training classes and give us insight into any biases that may exist on the model. By having these clear metrics, we can get a good idea of how the model will perform when deployed into production, which will ultimately drive performance of the product and its impact in the market.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |https://www.notion.so/Model-Evaluation-97bfa579b9684733b1b3b52c449daedc                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |Article                                                |All Levels  |Toma                                     |March 13, 2021   |

Huge hype cycles and rapidly evolving tools, though, have blurred the lines between the two, making it difficult to tell where AI ends and AR begins. This post aims to disambiguate AR and AI. It covers how AR and AI work together, the current state of SDKs and APIs for each, and some practical ways to combine them to build incredible mobile experiences.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/combining-artificial-intelligence-and-augmented-reality-in-mobile-apps-e0e0ad2cfddc                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |Article                                                |All Levels  |Toma                                     |March 13, 2021   |

Second, it trains a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify residential buildings into architectural styles, taking into account spatial dependencies of these styles. Third, it investigates whether architectural styles influence house prices. For resales , the architectural style is a significant determinant of transaction prices while no such effect is found for new buildings.
