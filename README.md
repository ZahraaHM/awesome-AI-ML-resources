# awesome-AI-ML-resources
This repository contains resources shared by scholars in **Bertelsmann Scholasrship Track - Udacity**

Any suggestions to improve the repo are most welcome. You can create the issue and describe briefly what you can add to improve this collection of resources.
This is the initial change in this repo. I am planning to create a Static Website where all of the resources can be stored all together. This will surely help for the beginners too.
