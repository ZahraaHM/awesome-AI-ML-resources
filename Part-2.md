In light of recent advances in machine intelligence, a num-ber of scientists, philosophers and technologists have revived the discussion about the potentiallycatastrophic risks entailed by such an entity.  In this article, we trace the origins and developmentof the neo-fear of superintelligence, and some of the major proposals for its containment. We arguethat total containment is, in principle, impossible, due to fundamental limits inherent to comput-ing itself. Assuming that a superintelligence will contain a program that includes all the programsthat can be executed by a universal Turing machine on input potentially as complex as the state ofthe world, strict containment requires simulations of such a program, something theoretically (andpractically) impossible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |https://jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/12202/26642                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |Article                                                |All Levels  |Alexa.N.                                 |January 18, 2021 |

Most studies of machine behavior modelling, however, rely on symbolic or selected parametric sensory inputs and built-in knowledge relevant to a given task. Here, we propose that an observer can model the behavior of an actor through visual processing alone, without any prior symbolic information and assumptions about relevant inputs. To test this hypothesis, we designed a non-verbal non-symbolic robotic experiment in which an observer must visualize future plans of an actor robot, based only on an image depicting the initial scene of the actor robot. We found that an AI-observer is able to visualize the future plans of the actor with 98.5% success across four different activities, even when the activity is not known a-priori. We hypothesize that such visual behavior modeling is an essential cognitive ability that will allow machines to understand and coordinate with surrounding agents, while sidestepping the notorious symbol grounding problem. Through a false-belief test, we suggest that this approach may be a precursor to Theory of Mind, one of the distinguishing hallmarks of primate social cognition.|https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-77918-x?utm_source=red&utm_medium=nl&utm_campaign=ada&utm_content=2021117                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |Article                                                |All Levels  |Alexa.N.                                 |January 18, 2021 |

To predict which mutations may lead to viral escape, Hie et al. used a machine learning technique for natural language processing with two components: grammar (or syntax) and meaning (or semantics) (see the Perspective by Kim and Przytycka). Three different unsupervised language models were constructed for influenza A hemagglutinin, HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike glycoprotein. Semantic landscapes for these viruses predicted viral escape mutations that produce sequences that are syntactically and/or grammatically correct but effectively different in semantics and thus able to evade the immune system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6526/284?utm_source=red&utm_medium=nl&utm_campaign=ada&utm_content=2021117                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |Article                                                |Intermediate|Alexa.N.                                 |January 18, 2021 |
