It even goes into great depths on some of the mathematical aspects of deeplearning like gradient descent, normalization, regularization... etc. The book also shows you how to implement neural networks from scratch using python and train them on the MNIST dataset                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |Book,Tutorial,Article                                  |All Levels  |Ernest Wambua                            |December 9, 2020 |
